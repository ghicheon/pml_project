 first of all, loading the csv files were needed.
 after that, we need to find the good features of the data set.
 In fact, I was struggling from that. when I tried all features, it took too much time and didn't finish. it might be a problem of my computer performance. 
 In the end,I decided to use numeric features. with numeric features, traing the data set finished whthin reasonable time.  I think and hope numeric values are essential.
 after training the data set, I tested it using predict function. It seems to work!
 


```{r}
library(caret)
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")


numeric_only <- sapply(training, is.numeric)

essential <- training[,numeric_only]

essential$classe <- training$classe

fit <- train(classe ~ . , data= essential ,preProcess=c("center","scale"),method="rf", prox=TRUE)

predict(fit, newdata=essential)

```
